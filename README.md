# PebbleGame

Welcome to our Pebble Game program. This file constists of 4 java files for the Bags, PebbleGame (which contains the Player class as an nested class), and their respective test classes. As well as a handful of different csv files for the testing and use of the Bags functionality.

To run the Game itself you can run the PebbleGame java file using the jar file. To do this open a terminal in the folder where the jar file is kept and write:

java -jar pebbleGame.jar

To run the tests load them onto an IDE and run them, we used intelliJ.

The tests we have included are for methods that are more than trivial and need to show that they will work, we have ommitted some tests for things like setters and getters as for some of these methods they only contain 1 basic line of code or have very simple functionality.

When you run the jar files you should notice that it will form the player output classes as specified in the original CA spec.
